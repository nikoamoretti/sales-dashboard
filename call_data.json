IT sent me to generic customer service phone tree 1, 5 Benny, explained the situation, he was able to see Susan Novak, looking to transfer me to their transportation group. Benny was talking, but kept cutting out. Thinking problem on his end? If DC'd I can call back and ask for Benny. Googled Sherwin Williams customer service and the number that came back was 800-474-3794. Benny did not return, timer on hubspot dialer still rolling, so were connected.

If they need anything those people respond pretty quickly. Dont usually deal with it bc they pride themselves with moving super fast, but they have a merchandising team that handles all of that for them. cole.bright@mkcoop.com @Nicolas Amoretti Not interested bc they feel like they have support and have no real issues. If the call doesnt record, he really does sound like theyre doing pretty well and probably not a need. HOWEVER, he did save my contact info, so I told him we would email him as well just so we had a connection. He agreed. So probably someone to email and maybe set on a follow up campaign every 90 days or something.",

Another report to look at just isnt worth it. Steel wheels. I asked if it would make sense if we could reduce the amount of softwares he was having to use. His answer: Not possible to consolidate, all of the class 1's dont report equally to each other. They get all of their info from primary and secondary. After that, all the info is gone. They talk to each other but not enough. They get reports everyday that never match the class 1 sent. RSI they get the rest of their information through RSI. He doesnt think there is 1 rail encompassed system that could do it accurately. Hes been doing this. @Nicolas Amoretti if call doesnt record, I tried to take the best notes. Let me know your thoughts on what he said and if there is an objection handle to this.",

Doesnt make sense (objection handled this a few times, theyre just too far along) Travis Vedral, Jack Shires david.parker@univarsolutions.com @Nicolas Amoretti GREAT call with this guy. He is interested, but theyre \"at the 1 yard line with Bork\" (theyre leaving RSI) and said \"even as interested as I am, we literally cant look at anything else bc starting this process over would eat my entire 2026\". He did agree for us to send him and email so that he has our contact info. Dont think we can move the needle on this, but its so close and has potential down the road wanted to share with you. Also, per the notes above, he said there are two of his peers that are in talks with us now, so wanted to share that so that we reflect well on them.",
